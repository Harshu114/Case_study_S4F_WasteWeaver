# WasteWeavers: A Case Study

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores the environmental challenges of improper waste management, with a focus on the harmful effects of methane emissions from organic waste in landfills and the loss of valuable resources due to inefficient recycling processes.

## ðŸ§ª Project Overview

Current waste sorting methods are often inaccurate and inefficient, leading to increased environmental damage. This case study analyzes:

- The environmental impact of methane emissions from landfills.
- The consequences of recyclables ending up in trash heaps.
- Limitations of existing waste sorting systems.

It also outlines the potential for smarter, automated waste segregation solutions to improve recycling rates and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

- `Case_study.ipynb` â€” Main Jupyter Notebook with data analysis, visualizations, and insights.
- (Optional: Add links or mention of any datasets used, if applicable.)

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `numpy`
- `jupyter` or `jupyterlab`

You can install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

> *(Create a `requirements.txt` file if you plan to share the environment setup)*

## ðŸ“Š Output Highlights

* Visual representation of methane generation trends.
* Comparative analysis of recyclable vs non-recyclable waste.
* Discussion of sorting inefficiencies and their environmental impact.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaways

* Improper sorting leads to significant environmental harm.
* Methane from organics is a major greenhouse gas contributor.
* Recyclable material loss accelerates resource depletion.
* Smarter waste sorting systems are crucial for sustainability.
